## How to run?

```

2. Install the requirements

```bash
pip install pygame numpy
```

3. Run the file

python falling_sand.py
```

press `space` to pause/play (super janky right now though)
1-7 to change the current material

have fun :)

currently only has 9 or so materials but added more frequently

```
materials:
    Water,
    Fire,
    Acid,
    Stone,
    Wood,
    Steam,
    Smoke,
    Sand,
    Concrete,
    Lava,
```

Also thinking of converting this to c++ and using SDL2 for better performance. But i don't know c++ so might take some time :)

If you have any questions / suggestions feel free to open an issue or a pull request. This is very much a casual project and right now just quick and dirty. So will clean it soon too
## Why do this?
Idk it sounded fun. I was playing a lot of noita recently and love the engine idea so I wanted to see how it worked and make my own version
